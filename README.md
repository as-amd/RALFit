# RALFit_tools

A test bed for the Non-linear least-squares solver RALFit.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have installed:
* [RALFit](https://github.com/ralna/RALFit)
* [CUTEst](https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/cutest/wiki/)
* [pypprof](https://github.com/tyronerees/pypprof)
* [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)

## To run

### Control files

The control files are a list of default parameters, which are kept in the
directory `control_files`.  These can be re-generated easily by editing
the file `DEF`, and then re-running the script `write_standard_control_files.sh`.

New control files can be made as needed.  If (as is usually the case) only a small number
of parameters need changing, these can be generated by using the script `generate_control_files.py`.
Run `generate_control_files.py --help` for instructions.

### `iteration_tests.py`

This runs the specified solvers on a number of problems from CUTEst.
This can be run by issuing, e.g., the command

```
./iteration_tests.py GaussNewton gsl
```

Detailed instructions, and more sophisticated options, are described in the help, accessed via

```
./iteration_tests.py --help
```

## `single_test_plots.py`

This runs the specified solvers on a single problem from CUTEst.
This can be run by issuing, e.g., the command

```
./single_test_plots.py GaussNewton gsl -p ARGAUSS
```

Detailed instructions, and more sophisticated options, are described in the help, accessed via

```
./single_test_plots.py --help
```
