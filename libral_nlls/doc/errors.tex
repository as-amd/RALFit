% Error and warning messages -- same for C and Fortran

Possible values are:
\begin{description}
\item{} {\tt -1} Maximum number of iterations reached without convergence.
\item{} {\tt -2} Error from evaluating a function/Jacobian/Hessian.
\item{} {\tt -3} Unsupported choice of model.
\item{} {\tt -4} Error return from an external routine.
\item{} {\tt -5} Unsupported choice of method.
\item{} {\tt -6} Allocation error.
\item{} {\tt -7} Maximum number of reductions of the trust radius reached.
\item{} {\tt -8} No progress being made in the solution.
\item{} {\tt -9} \texttt{n} passed is greater than \texttt{m}.
